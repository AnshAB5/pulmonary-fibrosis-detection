## Project Description

Pulmonary fibrosis is a respiratory disease characterized by the thickening and scarring of lung tissue. Early detection and accurate prediction of disease progression are crucial for effective treatment and management. This project focuses on using medical imaging data, specifically DICOM files, to predict Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) measurements for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

The main goals of this project are as follows:
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the provided CSV data to gain insights and identify relationships among the variables.
- Apply the EfficientNet model to process the DICOM files and predict FVC measurements for each patient in the test dataset.
- Utilize Multiple Quantile Regression to make additional predictions and compare the results.
- Ensemble the EfficientNet and Multiple Quantile Regression models to create a final model with improved accuracy.

## Usage

The project consists of several components that can be used individually or together. Below are the main components and their usage instructions:
